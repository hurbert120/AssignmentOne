        <h2>Biography of mentor</h2>
        <img src="chris-1.webp" width=140 alt="Chris coyier">

        <p>
            Chris coyier is a web designer and developer that tries to help other people get better at those things.

            he is the co-founder of CodePen, a social development environment for web designers and developers. CodePen
            is a front-end focused IDE in the browser allowing people to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related
            languages. Itâ€™s as much of a community and social network as a coding platform.

            Along with Dave Rupert, he is the co-host of a podcast called ShopTalk, a show about (you guessed it)
            building websites. they over 10 years and 500 episodes strong!

            he built CSS-Tricks, a website all about building websites, and ran it for 15 years, from 2007 to 2022,
            before selling it to DigitalOcean.

            my mentor is big on the power of writing as a way to improve yourself and be successful.
